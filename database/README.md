# Database server

Database settings and configuration.

## Common Commands

You'll need [Task][1] to do anything. You can run `task --list` to see the most common commands, or peek at `tasklist.yml` to see hidden commands.

Look at [common commands][3] in the :lock: devops repo for additional tips and tricks.

### Getting started

1. Make sure the following keys are set in `../.env`.
```
DATABASE_ADMIN_PASSWORD
DATABASE_ADMIN_USER
DATABASE_HOST_DIRECTORY
DATABASE_NAME
```
2. Run `task db:DANGEROUS:wipe-host-data` to delete previous database files in `$DATABASE_HOST_DIRECTORY`, if any.
3. Run `task db:DANGEROUS:initialize`.
4. Run `task up` to start the application stack. You can verify that everything is okay with Postgres by checking the logs with `docker-compose logs -f database`.
5. Connect to the cluster from the host, `task db:psql` (or `psql -h localhost -p $DATABASE_PORT -U $DATABASE_ADMIN_USER -d $DATABASE_NAME`). As with subsequent commands, you will be prompted for `DATABASE_ADMIN_PASSWORD`. You can set up a [`.pgpass` file][4] to bypass the password prompt.
6. Following the instructions in **"Securing the database"** below.
7. Run `rm ~/.psql_history` to clear the client history (which may contain the `DATABASE_ADMIN_PASSWORD`).
